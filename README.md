The Right Person

The right person is a project where people can describe their feelings with another in the moment they feel it. Sometimes memories sweeten the feelings. Maybe having a tool a, something like a logbook of our feelings, we could make our knowledge about ourselves more accurate.

I was inspired by this tableau project: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery/am-i-dating-right-person
